This project is launched for Kaggle Competition: [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) --- build a multi-headed model thatâ€™s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate.

This is my first kaggle game after graduation and made a lot of mistakes at the begining. After two-month soloing the game, I found it more important to learn than struggle in LB.
